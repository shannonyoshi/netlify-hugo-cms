# How to Add a Training

## Prepare the training

Publish the training to html5. Make sure to name the folder according to what you want the URL to be. For example, if you want the training to be at traininginthe21stcentury.com/trainings/what-is-blended-learning, the folder should be called "what-is-blended-learning" This folder name must be unique, so if you already have a training at /trainings/what-is-blended-learning, do not use this folder name again. You can see all of the current folder names [here](https://github.com/shannonyoshi/netlify-hugo-cms/tree/master/site/static/trainings). It's best to be consistent so use lowercase only, and replace spaces with "-"

## Upload the training

Once signed in to Github.com, [go to the static files folder in the repository](https://github.com/shannonyoshi/netlify-hugo-cms/tree/master/site/static/trainings) (also linked above)

Click on "Add File" and select "upload files" from the dropdown menu.

Drag and drop the folder with your trainings into the provided section.

Under the Commit Changes heading, add a short commit message in the top input box, something like: "Uploaded what-is-blended-learning training"

If you feel confident in this process, select "Commit directly to the master branch." If you select this, the website will begin to rebuild itself as soon as you finish, but that also means that if something goes wrong, it will affect your live website. It will take a few minutes to complete the build process. 

If you don't feel confident about this, select the other option to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." Once the pull request is made, send me an email to let me know, or add me as a reviewer to the pull request. If you do it this way, the changes will not appear until I have reviewed and accepted the changes you made. 

## Check for changes

It's always a good idea to double check that nothing got messed up, so go to your website and take a quick look at the pages. If something is messed up, contact me, and we can revert to the previous version.
