  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      I strongly recommend Carla Kincaid-Yoshikawa for the work she has done for OurExperienceCounts.com. Her efforts on our workshops have moved static materials to real interactive e-learning. Working in conjunction with subject matter experts, she has taken materials and has brought them to life for end users. She understands the effective use of graphics, text, video and audio to take a concept from a drawing board idea to a finished product. Because of her business savvy and artistic strengths, she is a true expert at developing e-learning and other graphic materials.

    quote: The entire time I have known and worked with Carla (1995 on) I have been impressed with the passion and commitment she brings to everything she does. She is mentally very quick and integrates creativity and practicality every step of the way. Whatever she says she will do, she does. You can always rely on her competence and her enthusiasm to ensure any work is done well.

    quote: Carla worked with Collaborative Strategies researching use and best practices of Internet-based collaboration technologies. Her ability to communicate with end users and developers of these technologies and identify key issues enabled her to write valuable case studies. These case studies were a win/win/win, offering technology developers a way to convey the value of their products, giving end users a forum to convey to potential clients how they were utilizing resources to enhance their products and services, and contributing to the knowledge base Collaborative Strategies offered to its readers. Her communication and project management skills also played a role in her ability to manage several virtual projects and work effectively with our national and international clients. I’m pleased that the work she did for Collaborative Strategies and the insights she gained into best practices for these technologies are now being put to good use with her work developing innovative, creative and effective blended learning programs.
