      description:
        - text: Our 3D courses are designed to be intriguing, engaging, and memorable for participants as they gain important knowledge and skills needed for their work. Face-to-face, instructor-led training sparks great ideas, broadens and deepens learning, and strengthens personal connections——important outcomes that are very difficult to achieve using most forms of virtual and remote training. Learning in 3d provides a sense of being with others, as well as opportunities for self-paced learning. Plus, it’s fun! Learning is enjoyable when it’s done right.
        - text: These environments provide a sense of presence with and connection to others as well as a feeling of dynamism. Interactivity makes training interesting, captivating, and unforgettable.  Role playing and simulations enhance people’s ability to learn through the practice and application of new knowledge in real-life situations, which increases retention and utilization. 
        - text: We offer many 3D training services. We design, develop, and facilitate new curricula including train-the-trainer sessions with additional assistance available for in-house trainers. And, we convert existing curricula into 3D interactive, interpersonal learning sessions with role plays, experiential and game based exercises, and discussions of key information. Currently available courses include Sexual Harassment (for employees and supervisors/managers), Change Management, and Communication and Teamwork.

      description:
        - text: Webinars, E-Learning, and Mobile and Social Learning are proven traditional forms of virtual training that save organizations time and money. A picture is worth a thousand words, so we work to synchronize relevant graphics, key words, and audio to reinforce key points and ensure that lessons are easy to follow, remember, and utilize. 
        - text: We work with clients to identify important information to include in e-learning and mobile learning solutions; and we ensure the training is effective through assessments. By incorporating interactive elements, we enhance engagement, build comprehension, reinforce retention, and keep learning fun.

        text: Our mobile lessons focus on key topics that can be completed quickly and easily by employees on-the-go. They are designed to be utilized in noisy, busy environments prone to interruptions. We work with you to keep them short, to-the-point, and clear——providing information learners can access on phones, tablets, or computers——anytime, anywhere.

        text: Social learning, or informal learning within organizations, plays a role in addressing organizational learning needs. Social media——such as videos, podcasts, internal blogs, wikis, team sites, etcetera——are used to facilitate employees ability to share knowledge and learn from each other. We offer guidance on how to develop these strategies and encourage peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.

    quote: Carla worked with Collaborative Strategies researching use and best practices of Internet-based collaboration technologies. Her ability to communicate with end users and developers of these technologies and identify key issues enabled her to write valuable case studies. These case studies were a win/win/win, offering technology developers a way to convey the value of their products, giving end users a forum to convey to potential clients how they were utilizing resources to enhance their products and services, and contributing to the knowledge base Collaborative Strategies offered to its readers. Her communication and project management skills also played a role in her ability to manage several virtual projects and work effectively with our national and international clients. I’m pleased that the work she did for Collaborative Strategies and the insights she gained into best practices for these technologies are now being put to good use with her work developing innovative, creative and effective blended learning programs.
