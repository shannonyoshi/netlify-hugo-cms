        - text: Our 3D courses and programs are designed to be intriguing, engaging, and memorable for participants as they gain important knowledge and skills needed for their work. Face-to-face, instructor-led training sparks great ideas, broadens and deepens learning, and strengthens personal connections. Training in 3D environments sparks great ideas, broadens and deepens learning, and strengthens personal connections which are often missing or severely limited in many forms of virtual and remote learning. Plus, it’s fun! Learning is enjoyable when it’s done right.
        - text: These environments provide a sense of presence with and connection to others as well as a feeling of dynamism. Interactivity makes training interesting, captivating, and unforgettable.  Role playing and simulations enhance people’s ability to learn through the practice and application of new knowledge in real-life situations, which increases retention and utilization. 
        - text: We offer many 3D training services. We design, develop, and facilitate new curricula including train-the-trainer sessions with additional assistance available for in-house trainers. Additionally, we convert existing curricula into 3D interactive, interpersonal learning sessions with role plays, experiential and game based exercises, and discussions of key information. Currently available courses include Sexual Harassment ( for employees and supervisors/managers, Change Management, and Communication and Teamwork.

      I strongly recommend Carla Kincaid-Yoshikawa for the work she has done for OurExperienceCounts.com. Her efforts on our workshops have moved static materials to real interactive e-learning. Working in conjunction with subject matter experts, she has taken materials and has brought them to life for end users. She understands the effective use of graphics, text, video and audio to take a concept from a drawing board idea to a finished product. Because of her business savvy and artistic strengths, she is a true expert at developing e-learning and other graphic materials.

    quote: Carla worked with Collaborative Strategies researching use and best practices of Internet-based collaboration technologies. Her ability to communicate with end users and developers of these technologies and identify key issues enabled her to write valuable case studies. These case studies were a win/win/win, offering technology developers a way to convey the value of their products, giving end users a forum to convey to potential clients how they were utilizing resources to enhance their products and services, and contributing to the knowledge base Collaborative Strategies offered to its readers. Her communication and project management skills also played a role in her ability to manage several virtual projects and work effectively with our national and international clients. I’m pleased that the work she did for Collaborative Strategies and the insights she gained into best practices for these technologies are now being put to good use with her work developing innovative, creative and effective blended learning programs.
