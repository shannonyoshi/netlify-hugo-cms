    name: Carla Kincaid-Yoshikawa
    position: Founder & Managing Director
    description:
      - text: Carla Kincaid-Yoshikawa has worked as an Organization Development and
          Training Consultant for over 20 years. Working with Fortune 500
          companies and organizations in the public and non-profit sectors, she
          has conducted team building, leadership development, strategic
          planning and change management processes. And she has designed,
          developed and facilitated training programs on a wide array of topics,
          from the team building, leadership development and change management
          related to Organizational Development to stress management, software
          navigation, new hire orientation, sexual harassment, and processes and
          procedures. A deep curiosity about how people learn, change and grow
          has created a core resource for her ongoing work in Learning and
          Development.
      - text: "As a Learning and Development professional, Carla takes pride in projects
          she has worked on because they simultaneously: increase organizational
          effectiveness; enhance the commitment, satisfaction, personal growth
          and professional development of organization members; and improve
          bottom lines."
      - text: "Early in Carla’s career, as she was completing her degree in Organization
          Development, she sought opportunities to work with experienced
          consultants as a way to learn the most effective techniques for
          Training and Development. In that endeavor, she was fortunate to work
          with several excellent consulting firms: Stonefield Learning Group
          (Knowledge Management, Change Management and Organizational Design);
          and Integration Strategies (Internal Organizational Collaboration and
          Integration)."
      - text: In her work with these organizations, she learned to utilize best
          practices and the highest standards for work with clients—in research
          and analysis, curriculum design and presentation, interactive meeting
          design and facilitation, and coaching and follow-up. Later work with
          another exceptional consulting firm, Collaborative Strategies (an
          industry analyst and research firm that specializes in collaboration
          technologies and best practices), gave her a foundation for
          understanding the technologies that impact so many industries and
          professions, including Training and Development. Her experience there,
          researching and using cutting edge collaboration technologies, enabled
          her to recognize and incorporate best practices for these tools into
          her work.
      - "Her career includes design and development of both instructor-led and
        self-paced learning courses for both in-person and remote learning. She
        has created and facilitated face-to-face courses on a wide range of
        topics, and first became interested in avatar-based 3D environments as a
        tool for learning while recuperating from a severe injury. Her son
        loaned her several of his video games to pass the time and she was
        amazed at her own reaction to playing these games: she found herself
        engaged by the drive to solve the puzzles and get to the next level—and
        realized what an incredible learning tool these games could be. In
        addition, she realized that 3D environments not only offered
        opportunities for activity-based learning, but they also provided the
        sense of being present with others that is so important for engaging
        attention and connection—the missing ingredients from other forms of
        virtual learning."
      - text: Over the past few years, 3D technology has made huge leaps in capabilities
          and usability. Carla  is excited to be involved in the emergence of
          this resource for Training and Development. She believes 3D virtual
          environments present an amazing array of new, powerful techniques and
          processes for learning and is working to incorporate the extraordinary
          benefits of 3D learning  into the blended learning services of
          Training in the 21st Century™.
      - text: Carla’s undergraduate degree in Cross-Cultural Communications from San
          Francisco State University gave her a grounding in the communications
          issues that are often a barrier to effective  collaboration. This
          perspective was a valuable asset when she earned a Masters Degree
          in  Organization Development from the University of San Francisco and
          began working in that field.  These aspects of her educational
          background continue to inform her work in training, facilitation and
          change management.
