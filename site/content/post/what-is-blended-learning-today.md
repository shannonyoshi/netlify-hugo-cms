The term "blended learning" came into use in the 1990's with the development of computer-based learning tools. And most definitions of blended learning focus on it as a combination of classroom and online learning tools. But that doesn't really capture what blended learning is today.

The basic practices utilized in creating blended learning programs---using varied ways of teaching information and skills that align with both the information presented adn the needs of learners---are not new to learning professionals. And these practices are also key components of a complete blended learning definition.

Whether designing for a traditional classroom or a technologically-based remote learning event, the long-standing questions for designing learning programs are 

* Who are the learners?
* What information and/or skills need to be learned and why?
* How much do they already know and how varied is their range of knowledge? 
* What modes of learning will best move the learner from ‘not knowing’ to knowing, and to the ability to use the information/skills taught?

Our global environment and expanding use of computer technologies make selecting the “best way” to present information more complicated than in the past, when classrooms were the main forum for learning. With technology, options for presentation have multiplied and the composition of learners has become more diverse.  So new learning technologies require a multitude of additional questions to determine what and how to present new information:

* Where are the learners located?
* Which of the technologies will be most helpful to learners, given the types of information, locations, time differences and learning modes involved?
* Will learning rely on individual or group learning? 
* Will presentations be lecture-based, with interaction between the lecturer and learners? 
* Can a recording of the presentation substitute for same-time participation?
* Is hands-on learning needed? 
* Can all or part of the content be self-paced? 
* What are the time and cost constraints involved?

While some of these have been relevant in the past—when the alternatives were generally about what to do for in-class vs. homework activities—each technology has specific capabilities and limitations that must be part of the equation for determining the best mix of methods for teaching: The number and variety of technologically-oriented learning tools requires careful thought in order to construct an effective blended learning solution. 

Two interrelated considerations that have always been of fundamental importance to learning are 

* The way people take in information, known as “learning modalities or “learning styles,” and 
* The type of information, which is often more readily presented using one learning modality vs. another

Learning modalities/styles are based in physical experiencing:  

```
   Hearing: Auditory mode
   Seeing: Visual mode
   Feeling: Tactile mode
   Movement: Kinesthetic mode
```

People vary in their innate and learned abilities to take in information using each mode. And specific types of information vary in how easily they can be conveyed via each one. When there is a mismatch between the mode(s) used to teach something and a person’s ability to take information via the mode(s) utilized, learning is much more difficult. For example:

> A friend of mine, who was poor at kinesthetic learning, decided to study ballroom dancing. Kinesthetic learning is the way physical activities are most easily taught and learned, so he found it the classes very difficult. After struggling through several classes, he had an insight of a way he could learn to dance using a method that always worked for him—diagrams. His strongest mode of taking in information was visual learning, and he intuitively defaulted to using a visual learning mode by diagraming the footwork patterns on 3X5 cards he could hold in his left hand and glance at as he danced. He eventually became a very good dancer using this method. But the time and effort involved was prodigious and few people would have sustained it to achieve success.

As learning professionals, part of our job is to make learning as easy as possible, whatever information and learning preferences are involved. That is key to the work we do, and is even more important to keep in mind as we blend new learning technologies into the mix of learning processes and practices to create truly effective learning programs.
